   <h2><b>Rachel Green</b></h2>
   <p>We first meet Rachel when she comes into the coffee shop with a wedding dress on from running away and leaving her fiance at the alter. Once a very popular, boy crazy girl in school, is now a spoiled young woman who depends on her father for income. However, running out on her wedding and moving in with Monica gave her insight to start a new life. With the help of her friends, she cut her credit cards in half, cut off her financial ties with her father and got a job as a waitress in the friends favorite coffee shop "Central Perk". Eventually Rachel spreads her wings out into the world of Fashion, and lands some really good jobs which is right up her alley, since she loves shopping! Rachel and Ross fall in love with each other and one day Rachel accidentally gets pregnant with Ross's child. Although along the way Rachel has a lot of problems meeting a good guy, there is always a connection between her and Ross, that in the end proves to be very strong indeed. Once a spoiled young woman, now a responsible adult and mother.</p>

<h2><b>Monica Geller</b></h2>
<p>Monica Geller, Ross's sister, is an aspiring chef who starts at the bottom of the food industry and eventually makes her way to the top. When she was younger, she was bullied because she was overweight and although skinny now, her friends never let the image of overweight Monica diet out. Now, Monica is a very energetic, compulsive and strictly organized neat freak who loves to clean and play everything by the rules. She also has issues with her love life along the way. Monica falls madly in love with her eye doctor, Richard Burke, who is several years older than her. Richard, being older did not have the same intentions and future goals as Monica did. Monica is a very goal oriented person who knows exactly what she wants in life and how she wants it so she knew it would not be able to work out with Richard. When they broke up, she was truly heartbroken, but through several trial and errors with men she found love in one of her closest friends.. Chandler Bing. Monica was lucky enough to be able to marry her best friend. Although unable to have children, as optimistic and aspiring as Monica is, her and Chandler adopted a child and lived happily ever after. She still loves to clean!</p>

<h2><b>Phoebe Buffay</b></h2>
<p>Phoebe Buffay is by far the most unique character in Friends. Phoebe has the strangest, heartbreaking and scariest stories of growing up, fatherless and with a mother whom committed suicide. She experienced a rough childhood, with crazy stories about what she had to go through to survive, including taking kids money and items when she was younger, which later on turns out that Ross was one of the boys she robbed when they were kids and she had no idea. Phoebe is a very excited, optimistic and silly witted hippy, whom loves playing guitar and making her own whimsical, strange songs like "Smelly Cat". She loves wearing jewelry and many rings on her fingers. On another note, she is also very sarcastic and comical. She is strictly vegan until she becomes pregnant, and falls in love with meat; as she says she doesn't eat anything with a face. Speaking of pregnant, Phoebe gets in vitro fertilization containing her brother and his fiance fertilized eggs, since the fiance could not get pregnant. She is very sweet and willing to do things for others always. Phoebe has an alter ego "Regina Philange" she often uses in situations to help her friends out or get out of trouble. Phoebe ends up being a personal masseuse, who gets married to a man named Mike, and has a strange outside winter wonderland wedding.. so strange and so beautiful.. perfect for Phoebe Buffay.</p>

<h2><b>Ross Geller</b></h2>
<p>Ross Geller, Monica's older brother, has experienced the most marriages, divorces and child births out of the whole group. When the show starts, Ross is in dismay when his wife tells him that she is a lesbian and has a life partner she's had her eyes on for a while. On top of that, she later comes to his job to tell him that she is pregnant with his child. That's when Ross has his first child Ben. Ross has his phD in paleontology and is always being made fun of by the group for his love of dinosaurs and the History Channel. He is a college professor as well. Ross has been in love with Rachel Green since high school, and never got the mutual love in return until they were older. Things were great until they weren't great and they broke up and saw other people for a while. That is until Ross impregnated her unintentionally, which eventually drew them back together.. true love never dies out. Before Ross ends up with Rachel, he was married to Emily, said Rachel's name at the alter and that soon became his second divorce. His third and final divorce was ironically to Rachel, when they got married in Vegas severely intoxicated. 3 divorces and 2 children later, Ross still got his dream girl from high school in the end.. miss Rachel Green.</p>

<h2><b>Joey Tribbiani</b></h2>
<p>Joey Tribbiani is an small time actor aspiring to make it to the big celebrity world of acting. He starts off with several small time roles in commercials, plays, and eventually lands himself a spot as a neurosurgeon in the TV series: Days of our Lives. Overall he is trying his hardest over the years to become famous and rich. Chandler, Joey's best friend and roommate, supports Joey over the years by providing a lot of money for photographs, props and audition necessities in hopes that he will one day make it big. Despite Joey being a not so great actor, he has a huge heart, is extremely handsome and kindhearted to his friends.. but definitely not to woman. Joey is a huge womanizer, and although very charming, he constantly dates women and never calls them back.. so at least he's successful in the woman aspect of his life. He never settles down in the show, even though he falls in love with Rachel for a short period. He is a very sensitive guy but one thing you must know about Joey is he does not share his food. He lives for women and food and what is Joey's most favorite line you might ask? "HOW YOU DOIN?!?"</p>

<h2><b>Chandler Bing</b></h2>
<p>Chandler Bing is by far the goofiest one of the group, always cracking jokes and choking up with awkwardness and gibber jabber words when he's in nervous situations. He is a financially secure data processor whom makes a more than generous sum of money, but none of his friends have any clue what he really does. Chandler is kind of wimpy, cigarette loving nerd, who has never ever been in a serious relationship. In fact, Chandlers first kiss was when he was 19 years old. Chandler hates Thanksgiving that relates to his weird childhood due to his parents splitting up because his father had a sex change into a woman. His dad is now a drag queen working at Viva Las Gaygas that Chandler doesn't keep in contact with until he gets married. Oh speaking of marriage.. the girl Chandler used to make fun of because she was fat, Monica, later becomes the love of his life and his wife. The one serious relationship he ever was in that started off as a fling, ended in a marriage with two adopted babies; as Chandler was also unable to provide Monica with children. Although he makes jokes on just about everything, the one thing he doesn't joke about is his love for his friends, especially Monica.</p>
